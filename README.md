This is my first time writing a README/tutorial, so forgive me if I don't follow any norms.
This project began with my wife getting a great deal on a used Power Wheels Cars. 

Like this one: https://foter.com/products/vintage-style-power-wheels-car

It did not come with a remote and she wanted me to get one and get it working so she could drive it around with Halloween props.
I'll be honest, in hindsight, I bought a bunch of unecesssary crap.
I bought a full wire harness, remote, and controller replacement kit. 
I figured this would save time with trying to figure out a different remote.
It did not. The wire harness sort of matched up but not really. 
I applied power to the new controller on my workbench and somehow, miraculiosly, was able to pair the very poor quality remote.
The whole thing was junk. I can't believe they even sell this stuff for more than 30 bucks new.

Anyways...I had a bluetooth 8bitdo NES controller already so I figured what the hell, I'll program a raspberry pi, add a few relays, 
a speaker, and some audio files to trick this thing out. I have a bit of experience with using Node-Red
